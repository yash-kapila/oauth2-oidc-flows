# OAuth 2.0 and OIDC

This repository captures basics of OAuth2.0 and OIDC standards. It introduces developers to the world of delegated access and authentication using OAuth 2.0 and OIDC respectively.

The [first section](oauth2.0/README.md) covers introduction to OAuth 2.0 - what it is, the need of it and different types of authorisation grants.

The [second section](oidc/README.md) covers introduction to OIDC - how is it different to OAuth 2.0 and different types of flows.

Example application is built using NodeJS(with Express). However, the principles behind the flows would be the same regardless of programming knowledge.
